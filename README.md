# TikTok-Claim-Classification-Project-
This project aims to analyze TikTok videos and classify their content as either **claims** (unverified information) or **opinions** (personal beliefs). By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project seeks to streamline the identification of misinformation and improve content moderation on TikTok.
